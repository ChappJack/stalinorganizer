# stalinorganizer
An exceedingly useful tool that takes an image path and judges it based off of how much red is in the image.
# VERY VERY IMPORTANT!!!
This project was a two hour coding adventure and should not be seriously implemented.<br>
If an image is primarily red:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is spared and kept on the computer.<br>
If it is not:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is deleted using os.remove().
<br><br>
This project is also very unpolished and runs only in the terminal. I would have given it a tkinter window, but I wanted to zero in on more serious projects.
